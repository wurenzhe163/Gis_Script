## Why the interactive map does not show up

If the interactive map does not show up on Jupyter notebook and JupyterLab, it is probably because the ipyleaflet extentsion is not installed properly.
For Jupyter notebook, try running the following two commands within your geemap conda environment:

```
jupyter nbextension install --py --symlink --sys-prefix ipyleaflet
jupyter nbextension enable --py --sys-prefix ipyleaflet
```

For JupyterLab, try running the following command within your geemap conda environment:

```
jupyter labextension install @jupyter-widgets/jupyterlab-manager jupyter-leaflet

```

## How to use geemap in countries where Google Services are blocked

If you are trying to use geemap in a country where Google Services are blocked (e.g., China), you will need a VPN. Use `geemap.set_proxy(port=your-port-number)` to connect to Earth Engine servers. Otherwise, you might encounter a connection timeout issue.

```
import geemap
geemap.set_proxy(port=your-port-number)
Map = geemap.Map()
Map
```
