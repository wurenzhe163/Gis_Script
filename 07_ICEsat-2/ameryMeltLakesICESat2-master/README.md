# ICESat-2 meltwater depth retrievals: application to surface melt on southern Amery Ice Shelf, East Antarctica

## Data availability:
- The estimated depths for all algorithms and the manual method are compiled in [this CSV file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fliphilipp/ameryMeltLakesICESat2/master/data/allCompiledDepthData.csv). 
- The ICESat-2 ATL03 and ATL06 data is available at [NSIDC](https://nsidc.org/data/icesat-2/data-sets).
- Sentinel-2 Imagery used for the plots is accessible through the [Copernicus Open Acces Hub](https://scihub.copernicus.eu/) or [Amazon Web Services S3](https://registry.opendata.aws/sentinel-2/).

*Left: Sentinel-2 image over Amery Ice Shelf, 2 January 2020 showing ICESat-2 ground track 0081 acquired on the same day. The magnified areas show the four melt lakes considered in this study. Right: ATL03 data for the four melt lakes on the left, with each photon colored by itâ€™s confidence level for being a land-ice surface signal. ATL06 surface elevations are shown in orange.*

*Left: ICESat-2 ATL03 photon data over the meltwater lakes used in this study, with median depth estimates from the ICESat-2 algorithms at each location shown in red. Above each plot are the corresponding Sentinel-2 images, with the ICESat-2 ground track segment. Right: Comparison of depth estimate retrievals for each lake. To aid visual comparison, image-based estimates have been multiplied by refractive index, and background topography has been removed.*
